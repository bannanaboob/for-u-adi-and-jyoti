<h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
<p>I wanted to tell you that I feel like you have changed so much. I wish things were different, and I miss having Adi in my life. I believe it would have brought more happiness. I'm struggling, and I need some time alone. I hope you understand. I don't want to talk right now.</p>
